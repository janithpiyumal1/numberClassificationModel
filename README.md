# Image Classification with Keras and TensorFlow

Welcome to the **Image Classification with Keras and TensorFlow** project! This project is designed to introduce you to the basics of Keras and TensorFlow by building a neural network to classify handwritten digits.

## Overview
In this 2-hour, project-based course, you will:
- Learn the fundamentals of neural networks, TensorFlow, and Keras.
- Build, train, and evaluate a neural network model.
- Solve a basic image classification problem with high accuracy.

By the end of this project, your model will be capable of predicting digits from hand-written images with a high degree of precision.

## Learning Objectives
This project will guide you through the following steps:

1. **Encode the Labels**
   - Understand how to preprocess and encode target labels for classification tasks.
2. **Understand Neural Networks**
   - Gain insights into the architecture and functioning of neural networks.
3. **Preprocess Image Examples**
   - Prepare image datasets for training by normalizing and reshaping.
4. **Create a Neural Network Model**
   - Build a neural network using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend.
5. **Train the Model**
   - Fit the model to the dataset and observe the training process.
6. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Assess the model's performance using test data and performance metrics.
7. **Visualize the Predictions**
   - Display and interpret the predictions made by the model.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter **notebook/Google Colab** to get started:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/image_classification.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the project step by step.
